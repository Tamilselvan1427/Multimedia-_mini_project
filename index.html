   <p><Strong>Leo </Strong>is a 2023 Tamil action thriller film directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, starring Thalapathy Vijay in the lead role alongside Trisha, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun, and Gautham Vasudev Menon. The movie follows the story of Parthiban, a café owner in Kashmir, whose ordinary life takes a violent turn when he gets entangled in a series of shocking events that reveal his dark past. With gripping action sequences, emotional depth, and powerful performances, Leo became one of the biggest blockbusters in Tamil cinema. The music, composed by Anirudh Ravichander, added immense energy to the film, while its connection to the Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU) — which includes Kaithi and Vikram — made it even more exciting for fans.</p>

   <strong>Amaran</strong> (2024) is a heartfelt Tamil biographical drama written and directed by Rajkumar Periasamy, featuring Sivakarthikeyan as the brave Major Mukund Varadarajan and Sai Pallavi as his wife, Indhu Rebecca Varghese. The story is inspired by a chapter from <i>India’s Most Fearless: True Stories of Modern Military Heroes</i>, and unfolds as Indhu reflects on her late husband’s exemplary life while en route to receive his posthumous Ashoka Chakra award. More than just a war film, it sensitively portrays army life, the Kashmir backdrop, and the emotional toll on a military family. Released during Diwali on October 31, 2024, the film garnered praise for its screenplay, direction, performances, and music by G. V. Prakash Kumar, quickly becoming one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of the year. Critics lauded the film’s authentic depiction of military life without heavy-handed jargon, describing it as emotionally moving and deeply impactful.
